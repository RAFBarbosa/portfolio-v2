					I’m a front-end developer who loves creating user interfaces
					that are easy to use and look great. My goal is to build
					accessible, high-performance websites that focus on
					usability without losing style or functionality.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Currently, I’m working on my personal portfolio to showcase
					my skills and projects. My focus is on ensuring it reflects
					my dedication to accessibility and modern web practices
					while using tools like React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, SASS,
					and GraphQL.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					I have worked in civil engineering, printing, and other
					fields. Each taught me something new: attention to detail,
					problem-solving, adapting to changing technologies. These
					now shape my approach to web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I’m not coding, I’m usually into motorsport—whether
					it’s gaming, running a virtual Formula 1 league, or catching
					up on the latest races. Speed, strategy, and the thrill of
					it all feel a lot like coding to me.
